# TodoList.tsx Update Instructions

I've prepared the full updated code for your TodoList component with:
1. **Colorful stat cards** matching your design (8 cards in 2 rows of 4)
2. **Interactive Add Task modal** with all fields from your screenshot
3. **All filter functionality** working (Active, Completed, Due Today, Due Tomorrow, Completed Today, Recurring, Overdue)
4. **Full recurring task support**
5. **Checklist functionality** (up to 6 items)

## How to apply:

1. Open TodoList.tsx in your editor
2. Replace the entire file content with the code from TodoList_NEW.tsx (I'll create it next)
3. Save and the app will hot-reload

The updated version includes:
- Gradient colored cards for each stat type
- Modal dialog for creating tasks with all fields
- Recurring task options
- Dynamic checklist items
- Better filtering logic including "Completed Today", "Due Tomorrow", "Recurring"

Let me create the file now...
